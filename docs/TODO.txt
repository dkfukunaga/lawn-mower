General:
    - convert to using smart pointers to handle object ownership
        - maybe LawnDisplay should be a unique_ptr, since there should only ever be
          a single LawnDisplay instance?
        - this would mean MowerLogic would have a weak_ptr to LawnDisplay
    - remove all srand function calls and call once in main
        - probably will be in LawnDriver?
    - create function in Lawn to convert to array index

MowerLogic:
    - create framework for controlling mower
    - create basic mower logic routine
        - see mowerlogic.txt
    - research/brainstorm other algorithms

Lawn:
    - have a default value, with option for random
        - maybe random will be the range constructor with no arguments?
    - add reset function
        - return squares to default
    - add min/max range constructor
    - override bracket operator

LawnTest:
    - create tests for min/max range constructor
    - create tests for bracket operator override

Mower:
    - add wrapper for lawn reset function
        - lawn::reset
        - move mower to 1,1

LawnDisplay:
    - add wrapper for mower reset function
        - mower::reset
    - colorize lawn

LawnDisplayTest:
    - figure out how to unit test the ascii display
        - possibly print to file and then compare specific lines to test cases
          in another file

LawnDriver:
    - create new LawnDisplay instance
    - initiate MowerLogic
        - MowerLogic controls LawnDisplay
    - allow choice between algorithms
    - allow reset or quit on finish
    - allow interrupt to pause
    - option to step through each action
    - option to change delay
    - menu to choose lawn generation
        - default 14x12
        - random
        - custom (limits?)

Settings:
    - create parser for simple settings file
    - use settings file to configure colors, square sizes
    - define layout variables (margins etc)
    - define default lawn size

Future:
    - create script parser to parse text file mower scripts
        - possibly convert algorithms to scripts
        - maybe keep simple ones hard coded
    - different lawn shapes
    - run all algorithms in sequence and display results
    - calculate interesting stats
        - cells revisited
        - actions without changing squares
        - actions to squares ratio
